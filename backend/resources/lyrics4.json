Kelly mass\nYou gotta blast me yo, 'cause the Louisville'll\nHave your head lookin' like the top of a pistachio\n\nThe young gunner with the raspy flow\nGot every boyfriend thinkin' they girlfriend's a nasty ho\nMy heart laugh and it's small, maybe it's 'cause\nMy grand pop dropped right after the ball\n\nBanks hops out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that\nBulletproof snorkel when you hot, they hawk you\nI got the hood on my shoulder, chain big as a boulder\nThe 3-5-7 tucker, motherfucker!\n\nLooka here, ain't nobody 'round here scared\nI'm headed for the top and I'm almost there\nOh yeah!

your time do you\n\nTo my brother, Mikey Mike, stay up, homie\nTo my cuz, J.B., stay up, homie\nIf you locked in the box, keep makin' it through\nDo your time, don't let your time do you\n\nYou lookin' at a man that would die for his daughter\nJust to let her breathe\nAnd I'd definitely die for Jesus 'cause he died for me\nGive my eyes to Stevie Wonder, just to see what he's seen\nBut then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream\n\nI'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it\nBut half of my black brothers are still incarcerated\nLocked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock\nSome sold they soul, others used to sell rocks\n\nLook up in my mailbox, I get letters from my cuz\nAnd every week said he wanna hit the streets\nBut he never struck a deal 'cause his mouth will never squeal\nPut some money on his books and help him out with his appeal\n\nSend some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna\nIf you ever have to leave, I got your mother and your daughter\nBorn in this way of livin' and our youth is stuck\nTo be safe, it's safe to say, the justice system's fucked up\n\nIf you doin' 25 to life, stay up, homie\nI got your money on ice, so stay

[Incomprehensible] will have you stuck in that pill line\nYour bitch missed the V-I this weekend\nThe food in your locker keeps shrinkin', your celly feet stinkin'\n\nThe canteen ran out of menthols\nCan't see how grown men wash other men drawers\nNiggaz play the phone room reckless and get hit with new indictments\nTalkin' about old connects and new prices\n\nStress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face\nOr stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case\nThat shit I used to tell my walkie, Lil' Itchy\nAll he did was smoke weed and drink coffee, I know he miss me\n\nTo my

be\nThey scream 'Free Pimp C' but not see the pimp free\n\nWake up, roll call, another day gone by\nNow put a 'X' on November 25, I'm still alive\nOpen the dead roll balls\nNow this dead man walkin', parkin' million dollar cars\n\nIt's slavery, hard labor, catch the feel\nRedneck on the hearse while you walk, it's real\nWith a shotgun burnin' at the back of your dome\n300 years left, my dawg ain't never comin' home\n\nOne fight, dude got stabbed, he lost the nine\nAlmost died in Camp Jay, nigga, ride or cry\nEven suicide attempts, precious took his own life\nWhite boys can't handle the pain at

Kash Doll", "lyrics": "There was a little girl named Holly who had just turned six years old.\nOne Halloween night, her parents decided to celebrate their wedding anniversary by going out to a nice restaurant for dinner.\nBecause it was Halloween, they had some trouble finding a babysitter for their daughter.\nEventually, they called a teenage girl named Jessica, who lived down the street, and asked her if she could babysit for them.\nWhen Jessica arrived, the parents gave her their mobile phone number and told her to call them if there was an emergency.\nAfter they left, the babysitter fixed Holly some dinner and then sat down on the sofa to watch TV.\nWhen holly finished eating, she asked, \nCan I have some dessert? \nOK, replied Jessica. \nWhat would you like? \nIce cream! said Holly, smiling from ear to ear.\nThe babysitter got up and searched through the fridge. \nI can't find any ice cream here, she said. \nIt's in the freezer in the basement, said Holly.\nJessica opened the basement door and flicked the light switch, but the lights didn't turn on.\nShe carefully made her way down the creaking steps into the basement.\nShe eventually found the freezer and lifted the lid.\nAs she took out a tub of vanilla ice cream, she happened to glance out the window.\nIn the darkness, she saw a little girl with long blond hair standing outside.\nThe girl had a red T-shirt on and was standing with her back to the window.\nJessica couldn't see her face, but she noticed that the girl was wearing something black on her head.\nThe babysitter didn't pay much attention.\nIt was Halloween night and there were a lot of children wandering around the neighborhood.\nShe made her way back upstairs, put some ice cream in a bowl and placed it in front of Holly.\nthe little girl made a face. \nCan I have some chocolate syrup on it? she asked. \nOK.\nWhere is that? asked Jessica. \nIn the basement, Holly replied.\nJessica dutifully made her way back down into the darkened basement.\nAs she was searching for the chocolate syrup, she glanced out the window again.\nThe little girl was still standing outside, but this time, she was facing the window.\nJessica saw that she was wearing an unusual mask.\nIt was black with red trim and the mouth was covered in large, sharp white teeth.\nIt gave Jessica the creeps.\nThe babysitter retrieved the chocolate syrup and walked back up the creaking stairs.\nIn the kitchen, she poured the chocolate syrup on Holly's ice cream. \nThanks, said Holly. \nCan I have some candy sprinkles on it too? Jessica sighed. \nLet me guess… They're in the basement? \nYeah, giggled Holly.\nThe babysitter headed back down the stairs, into the darkened basement.\nAs she rifled through the cabinets, she looked out the window and saw the same little girl in the mask standing outside.\nThis time, the child was holding a large knife in her hand.\nPerhaps it was part of the little girl's costume.\nHowever, it seemed odd that a child's parents would allow her to go around at night armed with a knife.\nShuddering, Jessica found the candy sprinkles and ran up the stairs, taking them two by two, anxious to get out of the basement. \nThank you! squealed Holly happily as the babysitter sthe candy sprinkles on her ice cream. \nAll it needs now is a cherry on top… Jessica stared at Holly in irritation. \nAre you sure that's all it needs?\nThis is the last time I'm going down into that basement. \nI promise, grinned Holly.\nThe babysitter slowly descended into the darkness and opened the cabinet and found the cherries.\nLooking out the window, she noticed that there was no sign of the creepy little girl in the mask.\nJessica breathed a sigh of relief.\nShe was glad the girl was gone.\nThe whole situation was beginning to freak her out.\nShe picked up the package of cherries and climbed up the stairs for the last time.\nAs she entered the kitchen, she was greeted by a horrible sight.\nHolly lay face-down in her bowl of ice cream.\nA pool of blood was spreading out around her on the table.\nHer little throat had been sliced open.\nJessica screamed and dropped the cherries.\nShe ran into the bathroom and locked the door behind her before dialing 911.\nShe sat on the floor, tears streaming down her cheeks, desperately waiting for the police to arrive.\nAfter what seemed like an hour, she heard sirens outside and the sound of the front door being broken down.\nA policeman's voice called out her and she unlocked the bathroom door.\nThe police searched the house, but there was no trace of any intruder.\nA few minutes later, Holly's mother and father arrived.\nThey were horrified to see their young daughter's corpse being carried out on a stretcher.\nThe father sat on the steps outside, his head cradled in his hands.\nThe tearful mother approached Jessica.\nHer eyes were red from crying. \nWhat happened? asked the mother. \nOh God… I'm so sorry, said the babysitter, trembling with emotion. \nI was down in the basement… I looked out the window… There was a little girl in a mask… She had a knife… She was just standing there outside the basement window… She must have murdered Holly! \nBut Jessica, that's impossible, said the mother. \nThere aren't any windows in the basement… only a mirror…"},

{"title": "We Shall Overcome ", "genre": null, "artist": "Lyndon B. Johnson", "lyrics": "Mr.\nSpeaker, Mr.\nPresident, Members of the Congress:\nI speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.\nI urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause.\nAt times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.\nSo it was at Lexington and Concord.\nSo it was a century ago at Appomattox.\nSo it was last week in Selma, Alabama.\nThere, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans.\nMany were brutally assaulted.\nOne good man, a man of God, was killed.\nThere is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma.\nThere is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans.\nBut there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight.\nFor the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government -- the government of the greatest nation on earth.\nOur mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man.\nIn our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis.\nOur lives have been marked with debate about great issues -- issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression.\nBut rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself.\nRarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values, and the purposes, and the meaning of our beloved nation.\nThe issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.\nAnd should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.\nFor with a country as with a person, \nWhat is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\nThere is no Negro problem.\nThere is no Southern problem.\nThere is no Northern problem.\nThere is only an American problem.\nAnd we are met here tonight as Americans -- not as Democrats or Republicans.\nWe are met here as Americans to solve that problem.\nThis was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose.\nThe great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South: \nAll men are created equal, government by consent of the governed, give me liberty or give me death. Well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories.\nIn their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives.\nThose words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man.\nThis dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot be found in his power, or in his position.\nIt really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others.\nIt says that he shall share in freedom, he shall choose his leaders, educate his children, provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being.\nTo apply any other test -- to deny a man his hopes because of his color, or race, or his religion, or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice, it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom.\nOur fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy.\nThe most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders.\nThe history of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people.\nMany of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult.\nBut about this there can and should be no argument.\nEvery American citizen must have an equal right to vote.\nThere is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right.\nThere is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right.\nYet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.\nEvery device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right.\nThe Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent.\nAnd if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application.\nAnd if he manages to fill out an application, he is given a test.\nThe registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test.\nHe may be asked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of State law.\nAnd even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write.\nFor the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin.\nExperience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination.\nNo law that we now have on the books -- and I have helped to put three of them there -- can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it.\nIn such a case our duty must be clear to all of us.\nThe Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color.\nWe have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution.\nWe must now act in obedience to that oath.\nWednesday, I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote.\nThe broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders tomorrow.\nAfter they have reviewed it, it will come here formally as a bill.\nI am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and to visit with my former colleagues.\nI've had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow, but which I will submit to the clerks tonight.\nBut I want to really discuss with you now, briefly, the main proposals of this legislation.\nThis bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections -- Federal, State, and local -- which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote.\nThis bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution.\nIt will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the United States Government, if the State officials refuse to register them.\nIt will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote.\nFinally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting.\nI will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress -- I have no doubt that I will get some -- on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective.\nBut experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the Constitution.\nTo those who seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities, who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections, the answer is simple: open your polling places to all your people.\nAllow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin.\nExtend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land.\nThere is no constitutional issue here.\nThe command of the Constitution is plain.\nThere is no moral issue.\nIt is wrong -- deadly wrong -- to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.\nThere is no issue of States' rights or national rights.\nThere is only the struggle for human rights.\nI have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer.\nBut the last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress, it contained a provision to protect voting rights in Federal elections.\nThat civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate.\nAnd when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated.\nThis time, on this issue, there must be no delay, or no hesitation, or no compromise with our purpose.\nWe cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in.\nAnd we ought not, and we cannot, and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill.\nWe have already waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone.\nSo I ask you to join me in working long hours -- nights and weekends, if necessary -- to pass this bill.\nAnd I don't make that request lightly.\nFor from the window where I sit with the problems of our country, I recognize that from outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations, and the harsh judgment of history on our acts.\nBut even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over.\nWhat happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America.\nIt is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.\nTheir cause must be our cause too.\nBecause it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.\nAnd we shall overcome.\nAs a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are.\nI know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society.\nBut a century has passed, more than a hundred years since the Negro was freed.\nAnd he is not fully free tonight.\nIt was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln, a great President of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation; but emancipation is a proclamation, and not a fact."},

they don't want me to make it, that's why the niggas be tellin' me\nIf I don't get the chopper I'mma probably run up inside them\nThey better gimme a answer, I'm tryna be cool\nIf I don't get it then everybody gon' fear it\nEvery week I'm finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school\nBed blues, everybody open up somethin'\nYou can move all you want just not sudden\nIt ain't no thinkin' I was

long hair\nI send them choppers around there\nWhen I'm somewhere sittin' in a lounge chair\nOverseas, blowin' tree, blowin' green, throwin' B's\nLivin' like life is supposed to be\nAnd if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me\nTo the top, couldn't stop, had a major deal but it wouldn't pop\nNigas hated on me but I wouldn't stop\nAnd now life sweeter than a puddin' pop\nThink so slick, come and get me dog\nNone of y'all niggas fuckin' with me dog\nSome of y'all niggas comin' with me dog\nNone of y'all niggas' boots fit me dog\nYou think an echo was y'all\nYou need to think tactical dog\nWe laughin' at y'all\nWhile you thinking me and Lu radical, naw\nSeein' this shit that keep goin' on\nThen pick a different zone for your mobile homes\nStore fingerprints on your mobile phone\nWhen you sippin' that shit we keep blowin' on\n\nI'm bout that, I'm bout that\nThat Bentley out in that driveway\nCost more than my house did\nFuck land, I'm fly today\nFirst class if I fly\nCredit card ain't mine\nDon't know how I'm gettin' back\nBut in luxury I arrive (TURN UP)\nIPhone in my baby name\nLong way from that chirp\nStrip pole in my bedroom\nBut I'mma kill my daughter if she twerk\nI'mma kill my daughter if she twerk\nMiley Cyrus on that bullshit\nBut a real nigga can't judge\nThat for Billy Ray to have to deal with\nRecord deal, fuck college\nMissed out but no pyrex\nMy Harley got low milage\nThis white carpet in my project\n30 guns in my section, none of the homies got aim\nMy side bitch said she pregnant\nBut I ain't claimin' shit but the game\nI ain't claimin' shit but the game\nI ain't claimin' shit but the game\nAnd this one is mine, I don't trust his mama\nSo he don't got my name\nCheap rims on my ride\nMirrors loose as my beat pound\nI ain't addicted to shit\nMy weed man on my speed dial\n\nPop, pop, pop, pop, pop\nAR-15 with collapsible stock\nPicatinny rail with a three-point harness\nWith 150 round magazine and a dot\nAy, FMJ's by the box, nigga\nGot the same setup as the SWATs, nigga\nShouldn't find that surprising\nCause I bought the muthafucka from a cop\nAy, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty\nWelfare baby can't afford

hard to defeat myself\nFuck being a hip hop purist\nWhen I'm spendin' 50 thousand on Securus\nEmbrace the contradiction, you'll feel us\nRIP to the homies but long live the killas\nIt's why I look at God kinda odd\nCause these are the cards that he deal us\nRamen can't fill us, Medicare can't heal us\nAnd the mamas can't stop us and these choppers might kill us\nLook these wild niggas in they eyes\nIn the video it's some niggas that done died\nLooked the ghosts in the face and I cried\nNo Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride\nWith an L up sayin' free da guys like I'm Durk\nWith a clean record

With liberty and justice for all\nNeatly carved in what seems to be a wall\nThey would doubt that there was any starvation at all\nThat they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved\nFrom the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade\nEverything's so organized. They had to be well behaved\nAssumed they had clean energy, but took to no enemies\nVery honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies\nReligions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out\nAnd this must be the temple\nThis White.

How dare you?\nHow dare you come do me like that that\n\n[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]\nI got my eyes on like the fire zone\nLet's be bygones\nWon't you come and be a line in one of my songs?\nMaybe a whole verse, maybe the whole Earth my home\nSo let me show you around the crib\nTell you what I do, I show you what I did\nFlow is on the stove, I'm cooking for the kids\nWrist is in the freezer, heart is in the fridge\nBut we can warm it up, plug the Foreman up\nOpen the oven door, turn the saunas up\nStretch the Benz out, if it ain't long enough\nGet lost in the feeling, they're no longer us\nHop up out the coupe, hop up on the bus\nGive you 'get to the backs'?, code name for Rosa's sons\nWe're in a better place, give us condolences\nIt's like a player's mate, and like a coma love\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nAnd I hope it's all up to your standards\nCause babies really need to be pampered\nI'm behind these tents like a camper\nCause you're out there shining like chandler\nLike a chandelier standing there in your radiance\nI think we all need some shadiness\nOr some vision care, oh no, you didn't dare\nWhile I sitting here like Huey in his wicker chair\nYou know that isn't fair, how you just entered here\nGetting their hopes up, that they can interfere\nYou're so insincere, you know I got you\nHave you looked in the mirror? You know that's not cool\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nLet's have a cease fire, be some peace tryers\nLet's negotiate, because my cheeks tired\nFrom smiling all day\nEmotions need a motrin, a tylenol break\nI know you see my strategy, if flattery's a battery\nThen I'm a rabbit with a pack of 'D's in the back of me\nPause on all levels, everybody settle\nI know it sounded weird, I'm just trying to impress you\nI step forward with my best two\nIf all that fails, open swag to the rescue\nI said swag, and I'm sorry\nDon't mean to offend your sensibility I meant dress smartly\nJust trying to get you out this party\nCan you dig that? Ologist-Archae\nPlease be the Ferrari to my car key\nAnd I'mma hold my baby down like a car seat\n\n[Bridge: Bilal]\nYou know what you're doing to me\nYou got that firepower?, baby\nI just can't get enough\nNo, I can't get enough\n\n[Hook]"},
